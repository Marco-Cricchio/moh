## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Home screen polish: the terminal is cleared once at startup; a figlet-Slant
  "moh" banner with the "My Own Harness" acronym and the version number
  replaces the wordmark on tall terminals (one-line fallback elsewhere); the
  static hint line is gone and the footer now carries new (n), settings (s)
  and keys (?) (#292).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- TUI: thinking separators are now rendered on a single line.
- TUI: no rainbow coloring of thinking separators at `xhigh` verbosity (#287).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-28

First public release: a provider-agnostic, headless-first coding agent as a
single self-contained binary (Bun runtime embedded — no Node, no npm).

### Added

- The platform as developed across the pre-release campaign: headless core
  (agent loop, append-only event log, providers, permissions, skills, memory,
  subagents, MCP) plus the Ink TUI, `moh run`, `moh init` and `moh provider`.

- Compiled-binary distribution for macOS arm64/x64 and Linux x64: one-command
  `curl | sh` installer with sha256 verification, CI release pipeline
  (tag-triggered builds + smoke tests), and a Homebrew tap.
- Update channel: daily GitHub `releases/latest` check (opt-out, no
  identifiers, silent on failure) with an in-TUI update notice and the
  `moh update` self-update command (download, checksum verify, atomic
  replace; downgrade-to-stable asks confirmation).
- First-party skills embedded in the binary, lazily copied to `~/.moh/skills/`
  on first run via the existing hash-manifest upgrade semantics.
